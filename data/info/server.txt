//Stack Overflow of browsers
When you exceed the maximum call stack size by introducing too much recursion, the browser will error out with one of the following messages:

Internet Explorer: “Stack overflow at line x”

Firefox: “Too much recursion”

Safari: “Maximum call stack size exceeded”

Opera: “Abort (control stack overflow)”

Chrome is the only browser that doesn’t display a message to the user when the call stack size has been exceeded
Actuallly chrome consumes all the ram of device which causes to hang.
