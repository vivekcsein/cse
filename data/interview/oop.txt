Classes ?

Classes are a template for creating objects.
They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.
Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.
classes must be defined before they can be constructed.
One way to define a class is using a class declaration.

constructor ?

The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class.
